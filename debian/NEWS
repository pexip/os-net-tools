net-tools (1.60+git20161116.90da8a0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  After 15 years without upstream development, net-tools is being worked on
  again, fixing many long-standing issues.

  The bad news is that the output of many commands has changed, and it is sure
  to break scripts that relied on parsing it.
  
  If you have customs scripts that use any of these commands, please make sure
  they still work after this upgrade:

    netstat, ifconfig, ipmaddr, iptunnel, mii-tool, nameif, plipconfig, rarp,
    route, slattach, arp.

  Apologies in advance for the trouble that this may cause, but maintaining a
  separate version of net-tools just to keep the old format is something I am
  not able to do.
